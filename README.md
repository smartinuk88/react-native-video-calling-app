# React Native Video Calling App

## Overview

This project is a **Video Calling App** built with **React Native**, **TypeScript**, and **Expo**. It offers real-time video calling functionality with a seamless user experience, providing authentication and reliable streaming capabilities. 

### Key Technologies:
- **React Native**: The mobile app is built using the powerful React Native framework, enabling it to run on both iOS and Android platforms.
- **Expo**: Expo is utilized for its simplified setup and development process, making it easy to build, deploy, and test the app.

### Backend:
- **Next.js Custom Backend**: A custom backend is built using **Next.js**. This handles the server-side logic and interacts with third-party services.
  
### Video Calling Provider:
